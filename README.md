# Sirah alpha

## Description
The goal of the SIRAH project is to develop products and technologies from laboratory settings to market scale.
The project is based on 2 products: SIRAH alpha and SIRH beta.
SIRAH is an irrigation module at a prototype level development. The irrigation system has a nutrient and water
recirculation infrastructure installed which can be monitored with an irrigation panel and a sectorization of
water valves.
The potential of the smart irrigation product in the marked will be made in this task. Also, a social impact
assessment is crucial to determine the potential effect on the society of the product installation. The
elaboration of a social study and questionnaire for potential customers and stakeholders will help preventing
possible risks and impacts on the installation of the product. While the increase of vegetation and the creation
of access to fresh produce might signify an improvement, the acceptability to install these production systems
in a person's defined as “NIMBY”.
